THIS PROJECT IS MY TASK 2 SUBMISSION FOR THE CODTECH INTERNSHIP, WHERE I BUILT A FULLY RESPONSIVE ARIANA GRANDE ALBUM SLIDER USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT. THE GOAL OF THE TASK WAS TO CREATE A WEBPAGE THAT ADAPTS SMOOTHLY ACROSS DESKTOP, TABLET, AND MOBILE SCREENS, AND THIS SLIDER DEMONSTRATES THAT THROUGH CLEAN UI, SMOOTH TRANSITIONS, AND MOBILE-FRIENDLY MEDIA QUERIES. IT FEATURES HIGH-QUALITY ALBUM VISUALS, SIMPLE ANIMATIONS, AND A MINIMAL LAYOUT, AND THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS DEPLOYED ON NETLIFY FOR EASY ACCESS
